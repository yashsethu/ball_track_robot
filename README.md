Hey there! This is code, testing programs, and iterations of main code for my Ball-tracking robot! 

I used the OpenCV library and the alpha release of PiCamera2 to actually detect the ball from an image.

Hardware: Some motors, servos, ultrasonic sensors, a Raspberry Pi 4B, an Arducam OV5647 5MP Camera, and an H-bridge motor driver
